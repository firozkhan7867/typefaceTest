Requirements:

    1. Python 
    2. urllib library in Python
    3. bs4 (BeautifulSoup) in Python
    4. requests library in Python


Procedure: 

    Step:- 1
        import the above mentioned in our Python file where we want to run the application 

    Step:- 2
        we can use request library to get all the content of the website by using request.get()
        Make requests instance and pass into URL to of the request module.
        Pass the requests into a Beautifulsoup() function

    Step:- 3
        BeautifulSoup is library comes with an built in parser which helps us to extract the contents from the website.
        using this parser we can find all the image tags from the website.

                htmldata = getdata("https://www.sample.com/") 
                soup = BeautifulSoup(htmldata, 'html.parser') 
                for item in soup.find_all('img'):
                    print(item['src'])

    Step:- 4
        Using the BeautifulSoup to extract the url or source of the image tag. Using this we will be able to retrieve all the image source and urls
        after getting all the urls of the images. we can use the urllib library from Python

    Step:- 5 
        using urllib we can save all the images locally into our system by passing the source of the images into the urllib built in function.
        urllib comes with built in method " request " which we can use to retrieve the url and save in our system.
        

        urllib.request.urlretrieve("http://www.sample.com/img.jpg", "local-filename.jpg")

    Step:- 6 
        we can use the BeautifulSoup to extract the text from the website by identifying all the <p></p> tags from the website.


Conclusion:

    using the above process we can extract the text and image from the website.
